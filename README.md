Description:
This is a 'game' that has 3 mini-games. User must interact with terminal to access and choose their preferred game. 

The first mini-game is called Aline Invasion. It is inspired by the 1970s space invaders game. It runs on the turtle module. The player can move right and left using the right and left keys. They can shoot red lasers out of their spaceship using the spacebar. The win/lose mechanics depend on if the aliens (who are represented as turtles) make it past the user; if that happens they user loses and get game-over. Additional features include: timer, score, and a countdown.

The second mini-game is called Snake in the Garden. It is a simple snake game where the player must continue to eat fruit and grow without going out of the bounds of the screen and not touch itself. It is run on pygame. The player starts the game by moving. They can can move up, down, right, and left using the respective keys. Additional features include: automatic game restart, images, and a score.

The third mini-game is an Algorithm application rather than a mini-game. the user is met with three options, the first two are utilities while the third is a quit button that asks them if they want to continue. It has two distinct features/utilities. The first one allows its users to use an algorithm of their choosing. They must input in their list number by number and then the application spits out their original list and their sorted list. The second distinct feature allows the user to read from a selection of three algorithms. It can read its suited dataset, its style of coding, and its suited data type to sort through.
